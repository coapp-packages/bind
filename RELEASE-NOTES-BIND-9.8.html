The ADB hash table stores informations about which authoritative
servers to query about particular domains. Previous versions of BIND
had the hash table size as a fixed value. On a busy recursive server,
this could lead to hash table collisions in the ADB cache, resulting
in degraded response time to queries. Bind 9.8 now has a dynamically
scalable ADB hash table, which helps a busy server to avoid hash
table collisions and maintain a consistent query response time.
[RT #21186]
</li><li class="listitem">
				BIND now supports a new zone type, static-stub. This allows the
				administrator of a recursive nameserver to force queries for
				a particular zone to go to IP addresses of the administrator's
				choosing, on a per zone basis, both globally or per view. I.e. if the
				administrator wishes to have their recursive server query 192.0.2.1
				and 192.0.2.2 for zone example.com rather than the servers listed by
				the .com gTLDs, they would configure example.com as a static-stub zone
				in their recursive server. [RT #21474]
				</li><li class="listitem">
				BIND now supports Response Policy Zones, a way of expressing "reputation"
				in real time via specially constructed DNS zones. See the draft specification
				here:

				[RT #21726]
				</li><li class="listitem">
				BIND 9.8.0 now has DNS64 support. named synthesizes AAAA records from
				specified A records if no AAAA record exists. IP6.ARPA CNAME records will be synthesized
				from corresponding IN-ADDR.ARPA. [RT #21991/22769]
				</li><li class="listitem">
				Dynamically Loadable Zones (DLZ) now support dynamic updates.
				Contributed by Andrew Tridgell of the Samba Project. [RT #22629]
				</li><li class="listitem">
				Added a "dlopen" DLZ driver, allowing the creation of external DLZ drivers
				that can be loaded as shared objects at runtime rather than having to be
				linked with named at compile time. Currently this is switched on via a
				compile-time option, "configure --with-dlz-dlopen".
				Note: the syntax for configuring DLZ zones is likely to be refined in future releases.
				Contributed by Andrew Tridgell of the Samba Project. [RT #22629]
				</li><li class="listitem">
				named now retains GSS-TSIG keys across restarts. This is for
				compatibility with Microsoft DHCP servers doing dynamic DNS
				updates for clients, which don't know to renegotiate the GSS-TSIG
				session key when named restarts. [RT #22639]
				</li><li class="listitem">
				There is a new update-policy match type "external". This
				allows named to decide whether to allow a dynamic update
				by checking with an external daemon.
				Contributed by Andrew Tridgell of the Samba Project. [RT #22758]
				</li><li class="listitem">
				There have been a number of bug fixes and ease of use enhancements
				for configuring BIND to support GSS-TSIG [RT #22629/22795]. These include:
	    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
Added a "tkey-gssapi-keytab" option. If set, dynamic updates will be
allowed for any key matching a Kerberos principal in the specified keytab
file. "tkey-gssapi-credential" is no longer required and is expected to
be deprecated. Contributed by Andrew Tridgell of the Samba Project. [RT #22629]
</li><li class="listitem">
It is no longer necessary to have a valid /etc/krb5.conf file. Using
the syntax DNS/hostname@REALM in nsupdate is sufficient for
to correctly set the default realm. [RT #22795]
</li><li class="listitem">
Documentation updated new gssapi configuration options (new option tkey-gssapi-keytab and changes in tkey-gssapi-credential and tkey-domain behavior). [RT 22795]
</li><li class="listitem">
DLZ correctly deals with NULL zone in a query. [RT 22795]
</li><li class="listitem">
TSIG correctly deals with a NULL tkey-&gt;creator. [RT 22795]
</li></ul></div>
</li><li class="listitem">
A new test has been added to check the apex NSEC3 records after DNSKEY
records have been added via dynamic update. [RT #23229]
</li><li class="listitem">
<p>
RTT banding (randomized server selection on queries) was introduced in
BIND releases in 2008, due to the Kaminsky cache poisoning bug. Instead
of always picking the authoritative server with the lowest RTT to the
caching resolver, all the authoritative servers within an RTT range were
randomly used by the recursive server.
</p>
<p>
While this did add an extra bit of randomness that an attacker had to
overcome to poison a recursive server's cache, it also impacts the
resolver's speed in answering end customer queries, since it's no
longer the fastest auth server that gets asked. This means that
performance optimizations, such using topologically close
authoritative servers, are rendered ineffective.
</p>
<p>
ISC has evaluated the amount of security added versus the performance
hit to end users and has decided that RTT banding is causing more harm
than good. Therefore, with this release, BIND is going back to the server
selection used prior to adding RTT banding.

Prior to this fix, when named was was writing a zone to disk (as slave,
when resigning, etc.), it might not correctly preserve the case of domain
name labels within RDATA, if the RDATA was not compressible. The result is
that when reloading the zone from disk would, named could serve data
that did not match the RRSIG for that data, due to case mismatch. named
now correctly preserves case. After upgrading to fixed code, the
operator should either resign the data (on the master) or delete the
disk file on the slave and reload the zone. [RT #22863]

The secure zone update feature in named is based on the zone
being signed and configured for dynamic updates. A bug in the ACL
processing for "allow-update { none; };" resulted in a zone that is
supposed to be static being treated as a dynamic zone. Thus, name
would try to sign/re-sign that zone erroneously. [RT #23120]
